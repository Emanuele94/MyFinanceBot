This is my personal finance bot that takes in a prompt and iterates through facts sheets of my Finance Tools

### Scraper
In this repo i've uploaded the Python Flask APP that will be needed for scraping articles data out of a news website, in this specific case i'm scraping www.marketwatch.com
Python will use scraperapi.com to collect plain/text data

For personal use I'm running the lab on a EC2 (Free Tier) istance using docker
